\acknowledgements{
Writing a thesis is a challenging enterprise, and I would like to thank all the people who provided support along the journey.
First to both my supervisors, Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann (DRS) and John Overington (JPO) for giving me the opportunity and freedom of doing my own science. Then to all the folks who provided me valuable advice and enlightening discussion, in particular Sarah Carl, Robert Hoehndorf, Anika Oellrich, Felix Krueger, Rita Santos, Christoph Grabmuller, Benjamin Stauch, John May, Syed Asad Rahman and Pedro Ballester.
I have interacted mostly with two research groups during my PhD time at the EMBL-EBI, the text-mining and the ChEMBL group; I would like to show my gratitude to all the members of both of these teams. I would also like to include my family in the acknowledgements, in particular my mother Evelyne, my father Serge and my little brother Elliott, for providing mental support and cheese. All my friends should be present in this list, both from here such as the predocs or out from of the country such as the Haute-Savoie folks.
A special thanks to Sarah Carl (\textless3) and Jean-Baptiste Pettit, also known as JB and my mate, as well as to Jacek for the spiritual support. Finally I would like to sincerely thank the reader, for taking the time and energy to go through this document.
I deeply apologize in advance for the numerous people I did not mention here, and I will offer a free pub lunch to thank anyone reading this manuscript - just send me an email (samuel.croset@gmail.com) with the subject "THESIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT" to claim your meal.
