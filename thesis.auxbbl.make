The similarity between two diseases (A) can be calculated by looking at the shared drugs used for the treatment of these diseases (B) or at the commonly shared pathways (C).

In theory, the more specific the molecule is to the binding site, the more accurate the pharmacological response will be.

(A) Traditional drug discovery workflow: From biological evidences showing the involvement of a protein in a process relevant to a particular disease of interest, a series of chemicals are screened for bioactivity. Potent and safe molecules will become drugs indicated for the disease. Paul Ehrlich postulated that chemicals should be as specific as possible against the target (organism or protein), in order to increase the control over the pharmacology. The concept of "magic bullet" describes such an ideal therapeutic compound. (B) Repositioning hypothesis: Often, a small molecule binds to other proteins (so called off-targets), themselves potentially involved in other pathologies.

For instance drug X and Y are considered similar because they share a significant amount of genes up and down related.

The 3D structure of proteins and their respective binding sites can be compared using a scoring function. On this basis, it is assumed that similar binding sites can bind the same ligand. For instance, knowing that protein X has a similar binding site to the one in protein Y, and that molecule Z binds to protein X, one can forward the hypothesis stating that molecule Z should bind to protein Y too.

(A) Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are associated with a phenotypic trait, here LDL cholesterol. The gene where the SNP is found (HMGCR) encodes for a protein, targeted by statins (drug class). Statins are indicated as cholesterol lowering agents, which is confirmed by the trait associated with the SNP. (B) Sometimes the trait associated with the SNP diverges from the indication of the drug, as shown on the diagram (post-traumatic stress disorder against smoking cessation). In such cases, a repositioning hypothesis can be generated. Examples are detailed in the text. See \cite  {sanseau2012use} for more explanations.\relax }}{34}{figure.caption.13}}
